 * For some reason yet to be debugged, POINTING_DEVICE_RIGHT gets sporadic false movements when the two halves are connected.
 * Right half works fine on its own with POINTING_DEVICE_RIGHT.
 * Current workaround is to turn on POINTING_DEVICE_COMBINED and build a separate firmware with POINTING_DEVICE_DRIVER = custom for the left half.
 * In this configuration, the sporadic false movements show up when using the right half on its own, but works fine when the two are connected.
